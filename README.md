# Welcome to my profile :penguin:

Thank you for spending your precious time to visit my [github](https://github.com/tienthegainz) :relieved:

I'm a tech geek. I am also a full-time software engineer. I do some open-source projects for fun outside intensive working hours and post them here.

## Some of my recent 4fun projects:
- [Product recognition and tracking system on edge device](https://github.com/tienthegainz/OutOfStockSystem) (*Publishing a journal about this as well*) :sunglasses:.
- [Face for rice](https://github.com/tienthegainz/Face_for_Rice) :rice:. *Here is my [blog](https://viblo.asia/p/he-thong-phat-gao-nhan-dien-khuon-matphan-2-gDVK2JkjKLj) about this project, inspired by my country COVID 19 free rice remote station*.
- [Image captioning using AI](https://github.com/tienthegainz/ImageAutoCaptioning) :robot:.

Thank you for visiting and have a good day :wave::wave:.
